##  Setup Instructions

### üè† Local Development

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dp62042/kids-store.git
   cd kids-store
````

2. **Backend setup:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Set MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, JWT_EXPIRES_IN in .env
   npm run dev  # or `npm start` in production
   ```

3. **Frontend setup:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL or `http://localhost:5000/api`
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) for frontend and your API on port 5000.

## Deployment Notes

### Backend

* Hosted on **Render** (Node/Express service).
* Ensure `startCommand: npm start` and environment variables (like MONGO\_URI, JWT\_SECRET) are set.

### Frontend

* Hosted on **Netlify** or **Render static site**.

* **Add redirect rule** to support React Router:

  * **Netlify:** Put this in `frontend/public/_redirects`:

    ```
    /*    /index.html   200
    ```
  * **Render:** In static site settings:

    ```
    Source: /*
    Destination: /index.html
    Type: Rewrite
    ```

* Add environment variable in Netlify:
  `VITE_API_URL = https://<your-backend-url>/api`

---

## Important Notes

* This is a **single-page application (SPA)**; deep links or refreshes need redirect rules to serve `index.html`.
* Token is stored in `localStorage` for authentication. Expired or invalid tokens redirect the user to login automatically.
* Cart behavior includes guest cart merging ‚Äî if two different users add the same item, they have separate carts (thanks to user-specific authentication and storage).
